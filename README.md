# Quantum linear regression on Orquestra
In this repository there is an Orquestra component for training an OLS linear regression model on a quantum annealer. 

As of now, the anealing phase is achieved through simulated annealing. When DWave's quantum annealing will be further supported, the component will be updated to include quantum annealing.
